# Keymaps and Controls

Because Noctavox is a modal program, keymaps depend on the specific context in
which they are used. Contexts are defined by a combination of the mode (e.g.
Playlist, Queue, Album, Search) and the Pane (e.g. Main pane, sidebar, popup,
etc.). Global keymaps and playback keymaps will work in almost every context,
with the exception of searching as not to affect a user's search query. 

**Keymaps are case sensitive.**

## Numeric Command Prefix
A number of commands can be prefixed with a numeric value to enhance user
control and precision. To use, simply type a value before certain commands. The
numeric buffer holds the 3 last digits passed to it. The buffer will clear
after any given command, but can also be manually cleared with either `Esc` or
`Backspace`. Out of bounds entries will result in errors, with the exception of
scrolling.

Currently, the scroll, multi-select, and play functions support these prefixes.

`11j` will scroll down 11 indices. \
`23g` will move the cursor to the 23rd index on any tracklist. \
`8v` will select the current and the next 8 items. (If all items are selected,
they will be deselected instead). \
`12<Enter>` will select and play the 12th track on a given tracklist (album,
playlist, queue, or search results).
