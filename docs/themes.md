# Themeing

 This document is designed to layout the specifications of the Noctavox
 themeing format. Should any changes be made, they should be reflected here,
 and laid out in the example below.

Several examples of custom themes can be seen [here](./theme_examples/).

Current theme specification: `v0.7`

### Hot keys

The theme menu can be accessed via the `Ctrl`+`c` keymap. Attempt to hot reload
the current them with `F6`. This will hot reload all themes, no need to reboot
when testing changes. Themes can also be cycled through via the `Shift`+`<` and
`Shift`+`>` keys. (Note: Using these keys does not reload recent changes, it
only cycles through the most recently loaded themes).

### Theme Folder Location & Formatting

Themes should be placed in the `$CONFIG/noctavox/themes` directory. This
folder will be autogenerated after running Noctavox for the first time. 

Any number of themes can be placed into the folder, there is no limit. Should a
theme fail to follow the specification (i.e. has required missing fields,
contains typos, fail to comply with the TOML parser, etc.) the theme will not
be loaded, nor will any errors be thrown. If a theme is not displaying, review
the formatting and any potential typos (such as forgetting quotation marks,
forgetting the `#` in colors, or using colons instead of equal signs).

Fields and sections can appear in any order. Optional fields can be ommited
entirely.

The following is the specification for the themeing format. In the
specification, the fields shown are for an example transparent theme.

```Toml 
# Noctavox Transparent.toml

surface_global      = ""        # Background of application [empty fields will attempt to render transparency]
surface_active      = ""        # Background of selected pane
surface_inactive    = ""        # Background of unselected areas
surface_error       = "#ff4646" # Color of error popup

text_primary        = "#d2d2d7" # Main text
text_secondary      = "#ff4646" # Accent text
text_secondary_in   = "#a62e2e" # Secondary text in unfocused panes
text_selection      = "#0a0a0d" # Text in a highlighted bar
text_muted          = "#646468" # Primary text when not in focused pane

border_active       = "#dcdc64" # Border color in focused pane
border_inactive     = "#343438" # Border color in unfocsed pane

selection_inactive  = "#82823C" # Multi-selected & unfocused selections

accent              = "#dcdc64" # Used occasionally to spice theme up
accent_inactive     = "#82823C"

[progress]
elapsed             = ["#ff0000", "#ffffff", "#0000ff"] # [REQUIRED] Determines colors of played portion of progress widget
                        # A single color value is also allowed

unplayed            = "dimmed" # [optional] All options: 
                        #   "dimmed"    => [default] fades colors from `elapsed`
                        #   "still"     => a frozen version of `elapsed`
                        #   "#ff4646"   => a solid single color
                        #   ["#ff0000", "#ffffff", "#0000ff"] A gradient of colors

speed               = 8.0   # [optinal] Determines how fast selected progress widget colors move
                            # default = 6.0
                            # Recommended to use a multiple of 2.0 for visual clarity when seeking.
                            # `0` will disable any scrolling, negative values will reverse direction of animation

bar_elapsed         = "▰"       # [optional] Character to display for played portion of progress bar
bar_unplayed        = "▱"       # [optional] Character to display for unplayed portion of progress bar
waveform_style      = "dots"    # [optional] default = "dots" | Determines waveform style
oscilloscope_style  = "block8"  # [optional] default = "dots" | Determines oscilloscope style

                                # All options for waveform/oscilloscope sytles:
                                    # block4            # Low resolution block display
                                    # block6            # Middle resolution block display
                                    # block8 | blocky   # High resolution block display
                                    # dots [default]    # High resolution dotted display

[borders]           # These fields are optional
border_display      = "all"         # [optional] default = "all"     [Other option = "none"]
border_type         = "rounded"     # [optional] default = "rounded" [Other options listed below]

[extras]            # These fields are optional
is_dark             = true  # [optional] default = true
decorator           = "✧"   # [optional] default = "✧" | Recommended to use a utf8 compliant character here, multi-char strings allowed
```

### Acceptable Color Formats

Colors should be formatted as their hexidecimal representations, enclosed in
double quotes: `"#1a2b3c"`

For those who wish to utilize transparency, simply leave the quotes empty or
write "none" with the quotation marks. (Certain elements may not be able to be
rendered as transparent. Your terminal may also play a role in what can/cannot
be transparent.)

### Borders
Users can create a borderless experience by setting the colors of the borders
to the same values as the respective background panel colors. Users can set
border_display to "none", allowing for borderless displays for transparent
themes. This may affect the padding of some elements.

As for the various border types, users can use any of the following:
```
Plain
Rounded
Double
Thick
LightDoubleDashed
HeavyDoubleDashed
LightTripleDashed
HeavyTripleDashed
LightQuadrupleDashed
HeavyQuadrupleDashed
QuadrantInside
QuadrantOutside
```
